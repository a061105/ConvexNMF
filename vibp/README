Variational Inference for the IBP.
-------------------------------------------------------

This package contains code for doing variational inference for the
Indian Buffet Process. The code is self-contained and runs with recent
Matlab distributions (we have tested it with r2008a and r2007a).
Please contact Finale Doshi-Velez at finale@alum.mit.edu or Kurt
Miller at ktmiller@gmail.com for questions and feedback (and bug-fixes
:).  Below we describe the different files in the distribution.

Files included in the distribution:
* tester.m: this is the main starting point for any experiments. It
  shows how to set up the data structures for the parameters of the
  inference algorithms and then runs the following algorithms:
  - finite LG variational
  - infinite LG variational
  - infinite iICA variational (to be made available soon)
  - finite iICA variational (to be made available soon)
* run_vibp.m: Runs variational inference for a finite or infinite IBP
  model.
* data.mat: example test data.  This is very simple data generated
  from a linear Gaussian model.

* vibp_base/compute_variational_lower_bound.m: Computes the lower
  bound on the log marginal likelihood of the data based on the
  variational parameters.
* vibp_base/vibp.m: Performs the variational updates for the finite
  model and keeps track of the lower bound.

* util/minimize.m: Minimize a differentiable multivariate function.
* util/v2pi.m: Converts stick-breaking variables v into feature
  probabilities pi.

* heuristics/run_search_heuristics.m: Run different heuristics
  (swapping features, subtracting features, ...) for improving the
  variational lower bound.
* heuristics/update_feature_order.m: Updates the features to be in
  descending order of probability.
* heuristics/update_small_model.m: updates a model proposal,
  increasing the subset of the data used.
* heuristics/initialise_small_model.m: initializes a model proposal
  using a subset of the data.

* vibp_finite/compute_var_theta_k.m: Computes an intermediate value
  for the update for the finite variational parameter nu.
* vibp_finite/update_tau.m: Performs the update for the finite
  variational parameter tau.

* vipb_infinite/compute_expected_pzk0_qjensen.m: Computes 
  E[ ln( 1 - prod( 1 - v ) ) ] using Jensen's inequality and a
  variational multinomial distribution q (see paper for details).
* vipb_infinite/compute_var_theta_k.m: Computes an intermediate value
  for the update for the infinite variational parameter nu.
* vipb_infinite/update_tau.m: Performs the update for the infinite
  variational parameter tau.
