Few things to note:

1.  The main script is the file "BMF_script.m". The main algorithm is in
"convexBMF.m".

2.  The file MixMaxCut.mexa64 might not be
runnable on your system. In that case, you can download the source here and
re-compile it through matlab MEX: 

https://github.com/a061105/MixingSDPSolve

3. The matrix "P" printed out at each iteration denotes the coefficients "c"
and whether they match one of a ground-truth latent feature. For example:

0         9.0000   7.0000
127.4914  3.2911   3.2250

means that the 1st coefficient of magnitude 127.4914 matches nothing, while
the 2nd matches 9th latent feature in the ground truth.

4. You might need to tune the step size "eta_rate" in convexBMF.m to be
smaller if observing an "increase" of objective during iterates.
